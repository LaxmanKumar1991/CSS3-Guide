            Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.

            When we were leaving one of the men that worked there joked that my friend was  "Superman" for eating his dinner at a 10 with no apparent discomfort at all. Lol. The staff was very helpful with our ordering and they were all very nice. If you're looking for a dish and you don't see it by name they can point you to the dish most like it. For example my husband was looking for Pad Prik King and the waitress pointed us to the spicy green beans with your choice of protein that wasn't at first readily apparent.

                Knowing how to write a paragraph is incredibly important. It’s a basic aspect of writing, and it is something that everyone should know how to do. There is a specific structure that you have to follow when you’re writing a paragraph. This structure helps make it easier for the reader to understand what is going on. Through writing good paragraphs, a person can communicate a lot better through their writing.

                The paragraphs that you write must follow a very specific structure. As mentioned before, you have to come up with the topic that you want to write about and then choose a topic sentence.

                For example, say you wanted to write a paragraph about dogs. The first thing you would do is write a topic sentence, such as, “When it comes to animals, dogs are a great pet.” Now you have a topic, which is not just dogs, but talking about what makes dogs a great pet.
                
                After you’ve come up with your topic sentence, you will then have to write three to five sentences that help you explain your fact. For example, in the paragraph about dogs, you may want to write about the different things people do with dogs as their pet. The following sentences would be great for a paragraph about dogs.
